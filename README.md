# Debt Tracker â€” Finance UI Edition

This is an enhanced UI build of the debt-tracker app (Next.js + Supabase) with a modern finance-style dashboard:
- TailwindCSS for styling
- lucide-react icons
- Recharts for charts

Follow the same deployment steps as the base project (Supabase + Vercel). See `.env.example` for env vars.

Notes:
- No sample customer data is included.
- Run Supabase `supabase/schema.sql` (from the original project) to create tables and RLS policies.
